Software for the robot Kocúr Mikeš

Current version is a demo where robot locates foam cubes using laser range sensor,
picks them up, and delivers them back home. It uses the rotation sensors to 
approximately estimate the distance to the cube, compass sensor for navigating
given the azimuth that is computed from the range sensor. A SHARP IR-sensor
detects presence of a cube in the cargo transport area.
